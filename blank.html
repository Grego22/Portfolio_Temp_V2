<p>GamePro is a video game review app I built on Rails.  I modeled my app after an old video game magazine called, "GamePro."  Users can upload pictures of their favorite video games and add reviews to their games and others.
  I used a Jquery rating system called "Raty," that allows users to give 1-5 stars to their games.  It's similar to the start system on IMDB.  I aslo implemented an
  average review method that takes all of the users reviews and averages them in a 5 star format and displays them when clicking on the game box art.
